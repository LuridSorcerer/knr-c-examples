# K&R C Examples

This is a little repo for example programs and exercises as I go through Kernighan and Ritchie's book, The C Programming Language, Second Edition.

There's nothing special here, and I'm sure this has all been done to better effect by others, but this is just for my reference. Have a look if you like.
